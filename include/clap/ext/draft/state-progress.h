// the main thread. The state restoration should be handled in a different thread so the user
// experience is not impacted by the loading time. The plugin can then report its progress to the
// host and notify it when it's done, so the host can update its UI accordingly.
//
// By this the host can disable the play button until all plugins are ready to play, and show a
// progress bar if it wants to. This is especially useful for large sample-based plugins that need
// to load a lot of data to restore their state, which can take a significant amount of time and
// impact the user experience if done in the main thread.
